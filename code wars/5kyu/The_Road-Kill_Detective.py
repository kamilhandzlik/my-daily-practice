My name is State Trooper Mark ("skidmark" ) McDingle.

My job is maintaining 117 miles of the Interstate, keeping it clean and clear of dead varmints.

It is a serious job and I take my job seriously.

I am the Road-Kill Detective



Every time I find some dead critter I scrape it up and record what type it was in my dead-critter notebook.

Mostly I just cruise up and down the interstate and only find a few racoons or the occasional squirrel...

But recently the road-kill has become much more exotic.

There must be some illegal private zoo back in the woods with a major security problem.

But that's none of my business... Anything beyond the fog-line is out of my jurisdiction.

Evidence
Here are some photos of what I came across last week:

There was a thing that looked like a hyena ==========h===yyyyyy===eeee=n==a========

a long black and white smudge that probably once was a penguin ======pe====nnnnnn=======================n=n=ng====u==iiii=iii==nn========================n=

and an unlucky bear that was hit going the other direction =====r=rrr=rra=====eee======bb====b=======

Kata Task
Even for a professional like me, the identification of flattened exotic animals is not always easy!

If it ever happens that I can't find all of the remains, or if there are gaps or other parts that I don't recognise, then I record it as ?? in my dead-critter notebook.

What I really need is a program that I can scan my photos into which can give back the correct answer straight away.

Something like this:

Input
photo (not null)
Output
the detected animal name, or ?? if unknown^
^ Note: An array/list of all "known" animals is preloaded in a variable called ANIMALS (refer to the initial solution)

        if re.match(pattern, remains) or re.match(pattern, remains[::-1]):
            return animal

    return "??"
